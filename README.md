How do I approach designing software?
    My approach to designing software is to first create a basic outline of what I am looking to create. This helps me to understand the full development process that I am going to take before actually committing to writing the code. I first create a flowchart which allows me to visualize the design, then I write pseudocode which lets me easily write basic ideas out without having to spend time worrying about syntax.
    
How do I approach developing programs?
    The development strategies that I used were doing research as to what I wanted to use within the OpenGL library to make my code work. This included videos, research through the provided documentation, and general online searching. This enabled me to create the most understandable and readable code. It also allowed me to iterate my design as I could take concepts from a previous assignment and apply them to the current assignment. For instance using individual vertices to draw objects vs the full array of vertices.
    
How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
    While I don't believe that I will be working much with 3D objects in my work as a developer (I am currently a Java backend developer), I may change career paths. Where I see that this will help me most is in my person passion projects. I really like developing video games in my free time, and so the use of OpenGL in the future can enable me to build a full 3 dimensional game!
